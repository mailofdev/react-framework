# features/

This folder contains feature-specific modules. Each feature (e.g., authentication, dashboard, user profile) should have its own subfolder containing all related components, hooks, services, and state management logic.

## What you can do next
- Add new features as subfolders (e.g., auth, dashboard, profile).
- Keep each feature self-contained for better scalability and maintainability.
- Add feature-level tests, documentation, and state management.
